Here's a basic recipe for you:\n\nIngredients:\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil or butter\n- 1 onion, chopped\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 2 large tomatoes, diced (or 1 can of crushed tomatoes)\n- 4 cups chicken or vegetable broth (or water)\n- 1 teaspoon dried basil (or fresh basil, if using)\n- Salt and pepper, to taste\n- 2 eggs, beaten\n- Optional: grated Parmesan cheese, chopped fresh parsley, or a drizzle of cream for garnish\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Heat the olive oil or butter in a medium-sized pot over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the chopped onion and saut√© until softened and translucent, about 3-5 minutes.\n\n2. Add the minced garlic to the pot and cook for an additional minute, being careful not to burn it.\n\n3. Stir in the diced tomatoes (if using fresh) or the crushed canned tomatoes. If using canned tomatoes, break them up with a spoon as they release their juices into the pot.\n\n4. Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth and add the dried basil. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for about 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.\n\n5. Season the soup with salt and pepper according to your taste.\n\n6. Slowly pour the beaten eggs into the soup while stirring continuously. This will create a silky texture as the eggs cook from the heat of the soup. You can either stir the eggs in a thin stream or gently drop them in and let them cook for a few seconds before stirring.\n\n7. Let the soup cook for another 2-3 minutes or until the eggs are cooked to your desired consistency (slightly runny or fully set).\n\n8. Taste the soup again and adjust the seasoning if needed.\n\n9. Serve the soup hot, garnished with grated Parmesan cheese, chopped fresh parsley, or a dollop of cream, if desired.\n\nEnjoy your homemade tomato and egg soup!"
